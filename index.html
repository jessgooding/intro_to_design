      <a class="button1 textspace" id="rotate-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan Foer</a>
	  <p class="on-page-twenty-two"> “Time was passing like a hand waving from a train I wanted to be on.
            I hope you never have to think about anything as much as I think about you.”
      </p>

      <div class="two" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button2 textspace" id="rotate-text">Milan Kundera</a>
      <p class="i-went-up-to-my-room textspace" id="rotate-text">“The Greek word for "return" is nostos. Algos means "suffering." So nostalgia is the suffering caused by an unappeased yearning to return.”</p>

      <div class="three" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button3 textspace" id="rotate-text">Amy Bloom </a>
      <div class="the-almost">“The past is a candle at great distance: too close to let you quit, too far to comfort you.”</div>

      <div class="four" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button4 textspace" id="rotate-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milan Kundera</a>
      <div class="noiselessly">“How could she feel nostalgia when he was right in front of her? How can you suffer from the absence of a person who is present?

You can suffer nostalgia in the presence of the beloved if you glimpse a future where the beloved is no more”
</div>

      <div class="five" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button5 textspace" id="rotate-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W. Somerset Maugham</a>
      <div class="farewell">“It is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who have lost it; but the young know they are wretched for they are full of the truthless ideal which have been instilled into them, and each time they come in contact with the real, they are bruised and wounded. It looks as if they were victims of a conspiracy; for the books they read, ideal by the necessity of selection, and the conversation of their elders, who look back upon the past through a rosy haze of forgetfulness, prepare them for an unreal life. They must discover for themselves that all they have read and all they have been told are lies, lies, lies; and each discovery is another nail driven into the body on the cross of life.”
      </div>

      <div class="six" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button6 textspace" id="rotate-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;André Aciman</a>
      <div class="from-this-broken">“Over the years I'd lodged him in the permanent past, my pluperfect lover, put him on ice, stuffed him with memories and mothballs like a hunted ornament confabulating with the ghost of all my evenings. I'd dust him off from time to time and then put him back on the mantelpiece. He no longer belonged to earth or to life. All I was likely to discover at this point wasn't just how distant were the paths we'd taken, it was the measure of loss that was going to strike me--a loss I didn't mind thinking about in abstract terms but which would hurt when stared at in the face, the way nostalgia hurts long after we've stopped thinking of things we lost and may never have cared for.”</div>

      <div class="seven" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button7 textspace" id="rotate-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R.A. Salvatore</a>
      <div class="something-stirred">“Nostalgia is a necessary thing, I believe, and a way for all of us to find peace in that which we have accomplished, or even failed to accomplish. At the same time, if nostalgia precipitates actions to return to that fabled, rosy-painted time, particularly in one who believes his life to be a failure, then it is an empty thing, doomed to produce nothing but frustration and an even greater sense of failure.”</div>

      <div class="eight" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button8 textspace" id="rotate-text">David Benioff</a>
      <div class="irrevocable-determination">“There are a few moments in your life when you are truly and completely happy, and you remember to give thanks. Even as it happens you are nostalgic for the moment, you are tucking it away in your scrapbook.”</div>



      <div class="nine" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button9 textspace" id="rotate-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blake Crouch</a>
      <div class="pavilion">“I don't want to look back anymore. I'm ready to accept that my existence will sometimes contain pain. No more trying to escape, either through nostalgia or a memory chair. They're both the same fucking thing.”</div>

      <div class="ten" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button10 textspace" id="rotate-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Arnold</a> 
      <div class="his-face"> “I think nostalgia is just a soul’s way of missing a thing, and like long-distance love, nostalgia grows deeper with time until the reality of what a thing actually was gets blurred to the point you miss the idea of the thing more than the thing itself. I like the idea of hot cocoa more than drinking it.”</div>

      <div class="eleven" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button11 textspace" id="rotate-text">Randy Pausch</a>
      <div class="remember">“I’ve often carried a crayon in my shirt pocket. When I need to go back in time, I put it under my nose and I take another hit.”</div>


      <div class="twelve" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button12 textspace" id="rotate-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bee Wilson</a>
      <div class="testimony">“When we talk of memory of food, we generally assume that nostalgia is a phenomenon that occurs late in life - like Proust being transported to his youth by a madeleine dipped in lime-blossom tea. But food memory is there from the start. Even babies have nostalgia!”</div>


      <div class="thirteen" id="smallbox"></div>
      <a class="button13 textspace" id="rotate-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Whyte</a>
      <div class="once-again">“Nostalgia is not indulgence. Nostalgia tells us we are in the presence of imminent revelation, about to break through the present structures held together by the way we have remembered: something we thought we understood but that we are now about to fully understand, something already lived but not fully lived, issuing not from our future but from something already experienced; something that was important, but something to which we did not grant importance enough, something now wanting to be lived again, at the depth to which it first invited us but which we originally refused. Nostalgia is not an immersion in the past, nostalgia is the first annunciation that the past as we know it is coming to an end.”</div>
